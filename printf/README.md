C - printf
Description
Create an simple exact replica of the printf function found in the C programming language. Using Variadic functions, structs, and multiple helper functions, the program we created will be able display inputed characters, strings, integers, and decimals (base 10). Whatever format specifier you use with our _prinf function, should display the same results when used by the actual printf function. This project is to show an alternative method of creating your very own simple printf function in the C programming language.

If successfully compiled and executed, the function should return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings). And if it fails, then the function should return a (-1) upon error and "(null)" if the string argument takes in NULL. If the format specifier is unkown, then the output would print out the format specifier as a string.

The code was made to handle all the format specifiers, but because of the simplicity of our code, we only used 5 so far. In the future, we will update the printf repository to handle more format specifiers.

Prototype
int _printf(const char *format, ...)

Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
Write output to stdout, the standard output stream.
format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail.
File Usage
File Name | Description

The _printf program will replicate the effects of the listed % format specifiers as when used with printf.

Function name	Description	Format Specifier
_print_char	Prints a single character	%c
_print_string	Prints a string of characters	%s
_print_percent	Prints a %	%%
_print_int	Prints an integer in base 10	%d & %i
_print_reverse	Prints the string in reverse	r
_print_rot13	Converts the string into Rot13	R
_print_binary	Prints the binary form of the integer	b
_print_unsigned	Prints an unsigned integer	u
_print_octal	Prints and octal number	o
_print_hex_l	Prints the lower case hexidecimal number	x
_print_hex_u	Prints the upper case hexidecimal number	X
Compilation
Our code can be compiled in either example

$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c
or (if you want to test for unknown format specifiers)

$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -Wno-format *.c
Testing the Program
The main.c File Test
You'll make a main.c file to test the program, in order to see if the custom _printf function works exactly like how regular printf manages to display the number of characters printed. The main.c file should contain the code displayed below. (Feel free to change the code inside main.c to test for any other test cases not currently displayed.)

Timmy@ubuntu:~/c/printf$ cat main.c
#include <limits.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include "main.h"

/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 * Return: Always 0
 */
int main(void)
{
    int len;
    int len2;
    unsigned int ui;
    void *addr;

    len = _printf("Let's try to printf a simple sentence.\n");
    len2 = printf("Let's try to printf a simple sentence.\n");
    ui = (unsigned int)INT_MAX + 1024;
    addr = (void *)0x7ffe637541f0;
    _printf("Length:[%d, %i]\n", len, len);
    printf("Length:[%d, %i]\n", len2, len2);
    _printf("Negative:[%d]\n", -762534);
    printf("Negative:[%d]\n", -762534);
    _printf("Unsigned:[%u]\n", ui);
    printf("Unsigned:[%u]\n", ui);
    _printf("Unsigned octal:[%o]\n", ui);
    printf("Unsigned octal:[%o]\n", ui);
    _printf("Unsigned hexadecimal:[%x, %X]\n", ui, ui);
    printf("Unsigned hexadecimal:[%x, %X]\n", ui, ui);
    _printf("Character:[%c]\n", 'H');
    printf("Character:[%c]\n", 'H');
    _printf("String:[%s]\n", "I am a string !");
    printf("String:[%s]\n", "I am a string !");
    _printf("Address:[%p]\n", addr);
    printf("Address:[%p]\n", addr);
    len = _printf("Percent:[%%]\n");
    len2 = printf("Percent:[%%]\n");
    _printf("Len:[%d]\n", len);
    printf("Len:[%d]\n", len2);
    _printf("Unknown:[%r]\n");
    printf("Unknown:[%r]\n");
    return (0);
}
Output Check
Your output should after compiling the program should look something like what's displayed below.

Bugs
It should be noted that our code does not handle the following conditions:

You don’t have to reproduce the buffer handling of the C library printf function.
You don’t have to handle the flag characters.
You don’t have to handle field width.
You don’t have to handle precision.
You don’t have to handle the length modifiers.
